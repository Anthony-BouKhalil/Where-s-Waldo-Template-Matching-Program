# Where-s-Waldo-Template-Matching-Program

Looped through each pixel in the search image to determine if the target image is a perfect match when the top left pixel of the template is overlaid for matching.

Used knowledge of matrices and nested for-loops to calculate the difference in the luminance of the two images to determine the coordinates where the target image perfectly overlays the search image.
